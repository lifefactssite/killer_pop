              <p>site, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“site,” “Company,” “us,” or “we”), provides&nbsp;<a href="https://site.com/">www.site.com</a>&nbsp;and the other websites under the site.com domain (collectively, the “Sites”), and our SaaS product, web design software, tools, and related services (together with the Sites, the “Service”) subject to your compliance with all the terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced herein (the “Terms of Service” or the “Agreement”).&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We've tried hard to keep this Agreement as readable and straightforward as possible. We’ve also added a series of short explanations of the legal language in plain English (they all start with "Basically...") to aid in understanding, but that part isn’t legally binding. If you have suggestions that can help us improve it or any questions about this Agreement, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@site.com">email us</a>&nbsp;and let us know. This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us. Except as noted otherwise below, this Agreement is the entire Agreement between us. By using the Sites and the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with these Terms of Service, our <a href="/legal/privacy">Global Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="/legal/eu-privacy-policy">EU &amp; Swiss Privacy Policy</a>, our <a href="https://site.com/templates/submission-guidelines">Template Submission Guidelines</a>, and any other legal notices or conditions or guidelines posted on the Sites.</p>
